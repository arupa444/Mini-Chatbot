# Mini Chatbot (Rule-Based + LLaMA 3.2)

This project implements a simple chatbot using Python and a rule-based approach. The chatbot is designed to respond to user inputs based on predefined patterns and rules.

## Features

- **Basic Conversation:** The chatbot can engage in simple conversations with the user, providing pre-defined responses to specific inputs.
- **Pattern Matching:** Uses pattern matching techniques to identify user intents and trigger corresponding responses.
- **Rule-Based Logic:** Employs a set of rules to determine the appropriate response based on the matched pattern.
- **Llama 3.2 Integration:** Utilizes Llama 3.2 for improved language understanding, allowing the chatbot to provide more context-aware and dynamic responses.
- **Extensible Knowledge Base:** The chatbot's knowledge base can be easily extended by adding new patterns and responses.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for developing the chatbot's logic.
- **Llama 3.2:** Used for enhanced natural language understanding and more accurate response generation.
- **Potentially NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** Might be used for advanced text processing tasks, such as tokenization, stemming, or part-of-speech tagging.

## Project Structure

The project likely consists of a single Python file containing the chatbot's code:

- `chatbot.py` (or a similar name): Contains the chatbot's logic, including pattern matching, Llama 3.2 integration, rule-based responses, and user interaction.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/arupa444/Mini-Chatbot.git`
2. **Navigate to the project directory:** `cd Mini-Chatbot`
3. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Run the Python script:** `python chatbot.py` (or the appropriate filename)

## Example Interaction

```text
User: Hello!
Chatbot: Hi there! How can I help you today?

User: What is your name?
Chatbot: I am a simple chatbot.

User: Tell me a joke.
Chatbot: Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Enhance NLU capabilities further using advanced techniques integrated with Llama 3.2.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Train a machine learning model to generate more dynamic and context-aware responses.
- **Contextual Memory:** Implement a mechanism to remember previous interactions and maintain context throughout the conversation.
- **Integration with External Services:** Connect the chatbot to external services, such as APIs for weather information, news updates, or other functionalities.
- **GUI Development:** Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly interaction experience.

## Requirements

- ** Python 3.x

- ** Llama 3.2

- ** Additional libraries (listed in requirements.txt)

## Disclaimer

This README.md is based on the assumption that the repository contains a simple rule-based chatbot implemented in Python. Further details about specific functionalities and implementations might be available within the project's code.
