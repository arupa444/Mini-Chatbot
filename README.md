# Mini Chatbot

This project implements a simple chatbot using Python and a rule-based approach. The chatbot is designed to respond to user inputs based on predefined patterns and rules.

## Features

- **Basic Conversation:** The chatbot can engage in simple conversations with the user, providing pre-defined responses to specific inputs.
- **Pattern Matching:** Uses pattern matching techniques to identify user intents and trigger corresponding responses.
- **Rule-Based Logic:** Employs a set of rules to determine the appropriate response based on the matched pattern.
- **Extensible Knowledge Base:** The chatbot's knowledge base can be easily extended by adding new patterns and responses.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for developing the chatbot's logic.
- **Potentially NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** Might be used for advanced text processing tasks, such as tokenization, stemming, or part-of-speech tagging, although it's not explicitly mentioned in the provided code.

## Project Structure

The project likely consists of a single Python file containing the chatbot's code:

- `chatbot.py` (or a similar name): Contains the chatbot's logic, including pattern matching, rule-based responses, and user interaction.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/arupa444/Mini-Chatbot.git`
2. **Navigate to the project directory:** `cd Mini-Chatbot`
3. **Run the Python script:** `python chatbot.py` (or the appropriate filename)

## Example Interaction

User: Hello!

Chatbot: Hi there! How can I help you today?

User: What is your name?

Chatbot: I am a simple chatbot.

User: Tell me a joke.

Chatbot: Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!

## Future Enhancements

- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Integrate NLU techniques to better understand user intents and extract meaning from their inputs.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Train a machine learning model to generate more dynamic and context-aware responses.
- **Contextual Memory:** Implement a mechanism to remember previous interactions and maintain context throughout the conversation.
- **Integration with External Services:** Connect the chatbot to external services, such as APIs for weather information, news updates, or other functionalities.
- **GUI Development:** Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly interaction experience.
